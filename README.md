# Towers of Hanoi Game
- This is supposed to be a user-friendly command line-based application to play the game.
- See the instructions in the game for a tutorial on how to play. 
- There is no indication that you won; it's simply a "playground" to play with the game mechanics and try varying levels of difficulty (you can choose how many disks are in play). 
- If you want to watch the computer solve it for you, choose 'watch' instead of 'play' in the options. It will show you a step-by-step solution to the problem and end in a random location, one of the two open pegs.
