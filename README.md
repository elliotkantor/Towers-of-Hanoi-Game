# Towers of Hanoi Game
- This won't solve the game (yet), but it is supposed to be a user-friendly command line-based application to play the game.
- See the instructions in the game for a tutorial on how to play. 
- There is no indication that you won; it's simply a "playground" to play with the game mechanics and try varying levels of difficulty (you can choose how many disks are in play).
